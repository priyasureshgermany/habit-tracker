/**
 * Version bump for Habit Tracker, run once per release.
 *
 *   MAJOR  first release in a new calendar month
 *   MIDDLE first release of a new week (weeks start on Monday)
 *   MINOR  every other release
 *
 * The week is what counts, not the day: a week with nothing shipped on its
 * Monday still gets its bump on whichever day comes first. Checking for a
 * Monday itself skipped every week that had no Monday release — September
 * 2026 ran 2.0.0 to 2.0.50 across three weeks that way.
 *
 * The higher rule wins and resets everything below it, so a week that also
 * opens a new month bumps MAJOR only. version.json carries the date of the
 * last release, which is what makes "first of the month" and "first of the
 * week" decidable without inspecting git history.
 *
 * Every release also gets a line in RELEASES.md, which the app shows under
 * Settings → About. Notes are required: a release nobody can describe in one
 * line is one nobody will be able to identify later either.
 *
 * One bump covers a whole branch. When review turns up more work, add notes to
 * the version already prepared rather than cutting another one — a round of
 * feedback shouldn't consume a version number. The pre-commit hook compares
 * against what is released rather than against the previous commit, so that it
 * doesn't have to.
 *
 *   node tools/bump-version.mjs --note "What changed" [--note "And this"]
 *   node tools/bump-version.mjs --amend --note "Found in review"
 *   node tools/bump-version.mjs --dry                 print what would happen
 *   node tools/bump-version.mjs --dry --date 2026-09-10   ...as if released that day
 *
 * A note is tagged with the kind of change it was, which the app reads to put
 * an icon beside it in What's new:
 *
 *   --fix     "something was wrong and now is not"
 *   --new     "this was not here before"
 *   --better | --note   "this already worked, and now works better"
